SMBclient - Connecting to the Share We use the so-called `null session` (`-N`), which is `anonymous` access without the input of existing users or valid passwords.

```
smbclient -N -L //10.129.14.128
```

Using smbclient to Connect to the Share

```
smbclient -L IPaddressOfTarget -U htb-student
```

Mounting to the Share

{% code overflow="wrap" fullWidth="true" %}
```
sudo mount -t cifs -o username=htb-student,password=Academy_WinFun! //ipaddoftarget/"Company Data" /home/user/Desktop/
```
{% endcode %}

[Remote Procedure Call](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/remote-procedure-call-rpc-in-operating-system/) (`RPC`) is a concept and, therefore, also a central tool to realize operational and work-sharing structures in networks and client-server architectures. The communication process via RPC includes passing parameters and the return of a function value.

```
rpcclient -U "" 10.129.14.128
```
